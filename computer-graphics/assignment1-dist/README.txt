# Assignment 1: Introduction

Student name: Miska Tammenpää
Student number: 729637
Hours spent on requirements (approx.): 4h 30min
Hours spent on extra credit (approx.): 5h

# First, some questions about where you come from and how you got started.
# Your answers in this section will be used to improve the course.
# They will not be judged or affect your points, but please answer all of them.
# Keep it short; answering shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.

- What are you studying here at Aalto? (Department, major, minor...?)
	- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science

- Which year of your studies is this?
	- Third year

- Is this a mandatory course for you?
	- No, it's not

- Have you had something to do with graphics before? Other studies, personal interests, work?
	- Yes, modeling, texturing and rendering with Blender. Also some graphics coding for a C++ course project in the Ogre3D graphics library.

- Do you remember basic linear algebra? Matrix and vector multiplication, cross product, that sort of thing?
	- I do.

- How is your overall programming experience? What language are you most comfortable with?
	- Quite good. Currently I'd say Javascript/Typescript

- Do you have some experience with these things? (If not, do you have experience with something similar such as C or Direct3D?)
C++: I do, course work and some own projects
C++11: Whatever has come up during other C++ use
OpenGL: Not much direct interaction

- Have you used a version control system such as Git, Mercurial or Subversion? Which ones?
	- Git, quite a lot

- Did you go to the technology lecture?
	- I'm not sure what this is

- Did you go to exercise sessions?
	- No

- Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both?
	- My own computer

# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

(Try to get everything done! Based on previous data, virtually everyone who put in the work and did well in the first two assignments ended up finishing the course, and also reported a high level of satisfaction at the end of the course.)

                            opened this file (0p): done
                         R1 Moving an object (1p): done
R2 Generating a simple cone mesh and normals (3p): done
  R3 Converting mesh data for OpenGL viewing (3p): done
           R4 Loading a large mesh from file (3p): done

# Did you do any extra credit work?
	- I did:
		Version control (git, found in logfile.txt)

		Rotate and scale transforms (+ the transforms on all other axes not just x and y)
			- Scaling is done with SHIFT + translation controls (Arrow keys & PageUp/Down)
			- Rotation is done with CTRL + translation controls

		Better camera
			- Camera movement with WASD + Space/Alt
			- Rotation with (left) clicking and dragging with the mouse

		Animation (object rotates around its own x-axis)

		Viewport perspective (without FOV control)

(Describe what you did and, if there was a substantial amount of work involved, how you did it. Also describe how to use/activate your extra features, if they are interactive.)

# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?
	- None found (except those that would have been fixed in the extra shading assignment)
(Please provide a list of the problems. If possible, describe what you think the cause is, how you have attempted to diagnose or fix the problem, and how you would attempt to diagnose or fix it if you had more time or motivation. This is important: we are more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.)

# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?
	- No

(Did you help others? Did others help you? Let us know who you talked to, and what sort of help you gave or received.)

# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?
	- Extra assignments were fun but even more fun was to just start implementing things I wanted to see in the program. 
	(This is actually how I ended up with the camera controls, I hadn't even read the description for the extra assignment)
	- Overall a nice warmup round, good way to get back into C++

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)
